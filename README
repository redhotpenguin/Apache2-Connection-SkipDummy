NAME
    Apache2::Connection::SkipDummy - Skip main server requests to wake up
    child httpds

SYNOPSIS
    In your httpd.conf:

     PerlPostReadRequestHandler Apache2::Connection::SkipDummy

DESCRIPTION
    End requests from the main httpd process to child processes which are
    only using for waking up processes listening for new connections.

    You can see this in your access log with the identifying user agent
    "(internal dummy connection)". You can remove these entries with
    mod_setenvif directives also, but this is a mod_perl based solution for
    those who don't have httpd compiled with mod_setenvif.
